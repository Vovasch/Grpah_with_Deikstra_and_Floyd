Here is a the realization of Floyd's and Deikstra algorithm

Yes, it not satisfied  your requirements, but mine are satisfied, because this program made money for me. For instance, you can't add node or edge
from UI, because there's no need for me. I didn't tried to write a complex program, it was create only to make money and get mark. (yes 30 grivnas it's money in 2020(more than 1$ actually)). 

There is a formula for Floyds algorigthm:

n - amount of nodes = amount of matrixes 

[n] - it is nomer of matrix

d[n](i,j) = min(d[n-1](i,n) + d[n-1](n,j), d[n-1](i,j))
