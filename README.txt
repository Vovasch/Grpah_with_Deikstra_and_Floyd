Realisation of directed weighted non-cycling graph. Deiksti's algorithm implementation.

Damn, I am on my second year of universty, still can't wright really adequete code. Hope your are not my HR of something like that.

First you need to do after closing this file is to check Task.jpg, then come back. Yes, I know that for Deikstri's algorighm we need directed weighte non-cycling graph, but there is actually just weitht graph. I told my teacher about this, he said it's ok, it is students to be easier. 
It's not easier, beacuse we need directed graph. 
So I decided to make a rule where all adges are directed from right to left and from top to bottom.

Then another thing is about visualization of graph.
You would see every node of graph with edges that are coming from it. Important: it's not a real structure or build of graph it's only imformation about node

For example:
0 A ----->  ----8---> F ----13---> Z ----12---> L

'0' is a distanse to this node from the begining
'A' is a name of node 
"----8---> F" is edge with it's weight and name of node where it goes

So we have node 'A' and 'F', 'Z', 'L' that are coming from this node.

2000000 - is like infinity.
